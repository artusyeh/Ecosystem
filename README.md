Devlog: Blobfish System

The most annoying yet most ambitious project by far. To carry on the blobfish lore, I did some research and created a deep sea ecosystem. It was fun experimenting with lighting and bone animations, and especially enjoyable 
creating a sense of depth by rearranging objects to make it look like my blobfish was hiding behind rocks. Balancing the ecosystem is so f-ing difficult that’s all I want to say. The anglerfish was really fun to make, as I 
wanted to try something more cinematic and make it seem like it was lurking closer and closer. I still don’t think this ecosystem is perfectly balanced yet, but with time I can definitely improve that aspect of the game. So 
beware of the jellyfish, they might just set your device on fire.

Note: Anglerfish appears later on.
